        The Effective Issuance is in fact slightly below this amount: an additional 45,000 META per day is diverted from the amount allocated to the lottery and burned (PID 137 - Details below).


         In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of META is also minted into the Dev address at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 META is harvested, then 9.09 META is minted and sent to the Dev Address.

         Every META minted at the Dev's address is burned in the weekly burn and never goes into circulation. As such, we do not include it in the issuance fee above.

        In addition to the above, META is also burned in the following ways:
         0.05% of every trade made on MetaExchange
         100% of META sent to developer address
         100% of IFOs META performance rates
         100% of META spent on profiling and NFT minting
         100% of the META bid during agricultural auctions
         20% of META spent on lottery tickets
         45,000 META per day (historically assigned to the lottery) (The META for this is generated by a farm - PID 137)
         3% of each round of prediction markets is used to buy META to burn
         2% of each yield harvest in the Auto META Pool
         2% of every NFT sale on the NFT market is used to buy META to burn
