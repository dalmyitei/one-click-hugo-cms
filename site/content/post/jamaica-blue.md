## It is a basic human right for everyone to control their money, data and identity.


### We believe that the built-in blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have the potential to empower millions to exercise this right.

 So we created the META project so you can have fun with a bold proposal by immersing yourself in the metaverse with Meta Education and make the fastest exchanges in the universe with Meta Exchange.



## Meta Exchange
Decentralized token exchanges, NFTâ€™s marketplace, earn tokens with high interest rates, invest and watch your decentralized universe expand.
We use BNB Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower exchange rates than similar ones on the market.
We do not hold any funds during your trades, meaning you have 100% ownership of your own cryptocurrency because we are a decentralized exchange.
Sell and buy NFT's from various collections, including for use in your metaverse games. A universe of possibilities with your non-fungible tokens.


## Meta Education

Meta Education provides an infrastructure to support a shared virtual world, also known as a metaverse.
Make interactions, expand your universe.
Meta Education consists of a decentralized ledger for land ownership, a protocol for describing the content of each parcel of land, and a peer-to-peer network for users to interact.
The development of large proprietary platforms like Instagram, facebook etc has allowed hundreds of millions of users to gather, interact, share content and play games. Its network effects have helped to cultivate vast online communities and gaming companies.
These platforms, controlled by centralized organizations, manage network rules and content flow, while extracting significant revenue from communities and
content creators who drive traffic to the platforms.
Meta Education intends to establish a network that allows its content creators to own and capture the full value of their contributions.

The adjacency of the terrain makes Meta Education unique parts of the web domains. Young
plots of land must be contiguous to existing ones. This adjacency allows the space
for discovering new content and creating districts dedicated to a topic or
theme. While each web domain can have an unlimited number of hyperlinks to other
content, parcels in Meta Education have a fixed amount of adjacencies. In addition, the contents of adjacent plots can be seen from a distance. For content creators, establishing districts provides access to targeted traffic; for end users, it allows discovery of thematic experiences. Users can roam neighborhoods and interact with the apps they come across.
With land scarce, developers can acquire users by purchasing land in high-traffic areas. This will allow secondary markets to develop around land ownership and rent as it is.

###### Meta Education is a new way of looking at Digital Marketing in Metaverse.
